## Manual testing
I manually tested this site in multiple ways highlighted below:
* I tested every feature and its functionality as highlighted below in the [user stories](#user-stories).
* I deployed the site in an early stage on Heroku to make sure everything was working as intended. 
* I received invaluable feedback from my mentor David, students in my community, family members and friends working in the industry.
* I tested the site for cross-compatibility in the two most used browsers, Chrome and Safari.
* I used DevTools to easily move between different screen sizes, simulating sizes between 370px to 4000px (but it is also functional on even larger screens given the max-width setting on the Body element to keep the content compact instead of stretched).

### User stories
**User Story:** As a site user/admin, I can navigate the site content from the landing page so that I can access all the content easily and find what I'm looking for.

* Expected:
    * The landing page should include a navigation bar with links to different pages.
    * Each section on the landing page should have buttons to access the corresponding pages.
    * Navigation bar pages should be adapted to the logged in user (profile page for users, admin panel for admin user).

* Testing:

    * Check that the navigation bar contains functioning links to all necessary pages (e.g., Home, Menu, Book, Register, Login).
    * Verify that each section on the landing page includes functioning buttons to access the relevant pages.
    * After logging in as both admin and user, verify that the authorized pages are showing up.

* Fix:
    * User profile page is displayed when admin is logged in.
        * Add a context processor for the Admin user and adjust the conditional statement in the base.html to not include authorization for the admin user.

    * After verification of details, users/admins should be directed to their account profile or received errors for incorrect details.
    * There should be a clear indication that you've logged in successfully.

**User Story:** As an admin user, I can log in to an admin account so that I can confirm/cancel requests and see all current/previous bookings.

* Expected:
    * Have a separate admin panel for authenticated admin users.
    * Admin is taken to admin panel upon logging in.

* Fix:
    * Edit details form didnâ€™t update the details that were changed, but instead updated all fields even if they hadn't been changed. This raised the validation error for all fields with validation.
        * Created an instance model to check for the field that had changed and only validate those details.
    * The bookings associated to the old user details did not register to the new user details. 
        * Added the User model in the booking Model with a user field and a Foreignkey and connected the user bookings to the user ID (instead of email as I had done previously) and created a view (update_bookings) to validate the bookings to the new user details.
    * New user details are not validated for already existing user details.
        * Use clean method for username/email fields in the EditForm form.

* Result:
Users can successfully access their account, view, edit, and delete account details.

## Validator testing 

- HTML
  - There were no errors present when passing through the official W3C validator ![W3C validator](docs/images/w3html.png)

- CSS
  - There were no errors present when passing through the official Jigsaw validator with direct input ![(Jigsaw) validator](docs/images/w3css.png)

- PEP8
  - There were no errors present when passing through the PEP8 CI Python linter ![PEP8](docs/images/pep8.png)

## Lighthouse testing 

This testing was done in an incognito window in Chrome to make sure the results were not influenced by browser extensions.

The lower scores were for two main reasons:
- The cdn imports from bootstrap, Google fonts and Font Awesome.
- Hero image and background image, which were compressed and even resized multiple times without a change in score. It was not possible to edit them further without a bigger change in quality.

## Wave accessibility evaluation

I also used the Wave evaluation tool to make sure I covered all my bases. 

The evaluation is free from errors on all pages.

## Bugs

See more feature related bugs in the [user story section](#user-stories).

- New CSS styling was not displaying properly in deployed project after changes.
    - Manually updated the staticfiles directory with "python3 manage.py collectstatic".
- Project deployment failed due to database error.
    - Added the elephantSQL instance link in project Config Vars section.

### Unfixed Bugs
- When there are too many bookings displayed on the user's profile, there is no space between the white box containing the bookings and the footer. However, the actual content remains visible. 
I chose not to address this issue because the staff will routinely clear all unnecessary bookings from the system on a weekly basis. Additionally, it's unlikely that users will have an excessive number of bookings simultaneously.
